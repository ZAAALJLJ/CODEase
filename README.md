# CODEase: Legacy Visual Programming

## I. Project Overview
A web-based visual programming simulator that allows users to simply create their own programs in the form of  “blocks”. Users can interact with these blocks through a drag-and-drop function where they can be placed, connected, and manipulated in order to create a program. The entire process of the created program can then be visualized and simulated line-by-line to help users understand how the program works.

## II. System Architecture
Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture, including key components and their interactions.

## III. Applied Computer Science Concept
Explain the core computer science concept applied in the project.

## IV. Algorithms Used
Discuss the algorithms implemented in the project, how they work, and how they are applied.

## V. Security Mechanisms
Discuss the security measures implemented in the project.

## VI. Development Process and Design Decisions
Explain how computer science theory influenced your development decisions.

## VII. Correctness and Efficiency
Explain how you ensured the project’s correctness and efficiency

## VIII. How to Run the Project
Discuss the step-by-step process on how to run your project

## IX. Contributors
Names of contributors, instructor
