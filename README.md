# CODEase: Legacy Visual Programming

## I. Project Overview
<p align="justify">A web-based visual programming simulator that allows users to simply create their own programs in the form of  “blocks”. Users can interact with these blocks through a drag-and-drop function where they can be placed, connected, and manipulated in order to create a program. The entire process of the created program can then be visualized and simulated line-by-line to help users understand how the program works.</p>

## II. System Architecture
<p align="justify">The main component of CODEase occurs within the SIMULATION page of the website. In the page, the user is presented with 4 sections, the Block Container, Playground, Code Process, and the Output section. Inside the BLOCK CONTAINER section is a collection of selected blocks, each having different functions and interactability relating to computer programming, such as initialize variable, loops, arithmetics, if statements, and such. The central feature of the website is the chracteristic of these blocks to be dragged and dropped inside the PLAYGROUND section. Moreover, the blocks inside this section can be connected and inserted into one another, creating a complete program. Once finished interacting with the blocks, users can click a button to simulate the connected blocks. Doing so would present the user with a detailed process on how the created program works which is illustrated in the CODE PROCESS section. Along this, the output of the created program will also show in the OUTPUT section.</p>
